Greenhouse system based on Arduino Leonardo.

It uses 3 air humidity sensors, 2 air temperature sensors,
1 water temperature sensor for receiving characteristics in real time. 

Based on that data microcontroller decide to open/close window/door
to provide favorable temperature conditions and perform irrigation
of agriculture plants.

Microcontroller outputs are connected to relays outputs. These relays
provide work of servomotors and solenoid valve.

System also has an LCD display and 3 buttons. It is used to change
threshold conditions, according to that microcontroler makes decisions.
